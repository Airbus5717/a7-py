title: Missing Features
description: Current gaps and deferred roadmap features.
---

## Source

Canonical roadmap snapshot is maintained in `MISSING_FEATURES.md`.

## Current status summary

- Full compiler pipeline is operational.
- Parser coverage is effectively complete for the implemented language surface.
- Remaining work is focused on language/runtime depth and ecosystem breadth.

## Deferred feature areas

### Labeled loops

Reserved in AST design but deferred due to syntax ambiguity in current grammar.

### Array programming library depth

Spec-level tensor and AI-oriented operations are roadmap items primarily at stdlib/runtime layer.

### Alternative backends

Architecture supports pluggable backends; non-Zig backends are future work.

## Priority direction

1. Semantic depth and richer generic/type-function validation
2. Expanded stdlib implementation surface
3. Additional backend targets
4. Broader behavior-level test coverage
