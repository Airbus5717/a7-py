description: Error categories, messages, and implementation boundaries.

## Error categories

A7 compiler failures are grouped by stage:

- Tokenization
- Parse
- Semantic
- Code generation
- I/O and internal failures

## Diagnostic surfaces

- Rich human-readable output with context snippets
- JSON output (`--format json`) with structured `error.details`
- Consistent stage-to-exit-code mapping

## Tokenizer and semantic error types

Representative typed error families in code:

- `TokenizerErrorType`
- `SemanticErrorType`
- `TypeErrorType`

These enums are defined in `src/errors.py` and used to map messages/advice.

## Current implementation limits

Known practical limits and caveats:

- Parser and compiler architecture is optimized around iterative traversals.
- Some advanced language/runtime features remain deferred to roadmap work.
- Certain spec sections describe future standard library surface beyond current implementation depth.

## Recommended debugging workflow

1. Reproduce with smallest source snippet.
2. Run with focused mode (`tokens`, `ast`, `semantic`).
3. Switch to JSON output for machine inspection.
4. Compare behavior with nearby examples in `examples/`.
