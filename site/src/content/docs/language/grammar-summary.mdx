## Top-level grammar

```txt
program          = declaration* EOF ;
declaration      = function_decl | type_decl | var_decl | import_decl ;
function_decl    = ident "::" "fn" "(" param_list? ")" return_type? block ;
```

## Type grammar

```txt
type_expr        = primitive_type
                 | array_type
                 | slice_type
                 | ref_type
                 | function_type
                 | ident ;

array_type       = "[" integer "]" type_expr ;
slice_type       = "[" "]" type_expr ;
ref_type         = "ref" type_expr ;
function_type    = "fn" "(" type_list? ")" type_expr? ;
```

## Expression grammar

```txt
expression       = assignment ;
assignment       = logical_or (assign_op assignment)? ;
logical_or       = logical_and ("or" logical_and)* ;
logical_and      = equality ("and" equality)* ;
equality         = comparison (("==" | "!=") comparison)* ;
comparison       = term (("<" | ">" | "<=" | ">=") term)* ;
term             = factor (("+" | "-") factor)* ;
factor           = unary (("*" | "/" | "%") unary)* ;
unary            = ("!" | "-" | "~") unary | postfix ;
postfix          = primary (call | index | member_access)* ;
```

## Statement grammar

```txt
statement        = var_decl
                 | if_stmt
                 | while_stmt
                 | for_stmt
                 | match_stmt
                 | return_stmt
                 | break_stmt
                 | continue_stmt
                 | defer_stmt
                 | expr_stmt ;
```
