## Type categories

A7 uses static typing and supports value types plus reference types.

Main categories:

- Primitive types
- Composite types (arrays, slices, structs, unions, enums)
- Function types
- Generic types
- Type aliases

## Primitive types

| Category | Types |
| --- | --- |
| Signed integers | `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `isize` |
| Unsigned integers | `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `usize` |
| Floating point | `f32`, `f64` |
| Boolean | `bool` |
| Character | `char` |
| String | `string` |
| Metatype | `type` |

## Composite types

### Arrays

Fixed-size contiguous sequences.

```txt
numbers: [5]i32 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Slices

View-like sequence type.

```txt
sub: []i32 = numbers[1:4]
```

### Strings

`string` is a first-class type used in declarations and function parameters.

```txt
greeting: string = "hello"
```

### References (pointers)

References use `ref T`. Nil is valid only for reference types.

```txt
node: ref Node = nil
```

### Structs

Product types with named fields.

```txt
Vec2 :: struct {
    x: f32
    y: f32
}
```

### Unions

Type that can store one of multiple member types.

```txt
Value :: union {
    as_i32: i32
    as_f64: f64
}
```

### Enums

Named variants.

```txt
Color :: enum {
    Red
    Green
    Blue
}
```

## Type aliases

Alias with `type` declarations.

```txt
Index :: type usize
```

## Pointer semantics

A7 also supports property-style pointer operations through preprocessing:

- `.adr` for address-of intent
- `.val` for dereference intent

These are lowered before backend emission.

## Notes from the curated spec

This page rewrites sections from `docs/SPEC.md` chapters on lexical/type structure and pointer semantics into one practical guide.
