title: Modules and Visibility
description: File-based modules, import forms, and visibility rules.

## File-based module system

Every `.a7` file is a module. There is no explicit module keyword.

```txt
// vector.a7
pub Vec3 :: struct {
    x: f32
    y: f32
    z: f32
}
```

## Import forms

```txt
math :: import "math"
vec :: import "vector"
import "vector" { Vec3, dot }
using import "vector"
sibling :: import "./sibling"
```

## Visibility rules

- Public export uses `pub` on top-level declarations.
- Non-public declarations are file-private.
- Struct fields follow file/module visibility rules in current implementation.
- Locals and parameters cannot be marked `pub`.

## Standard library files

Current registry includes modules under `src/stdlib/` such as:

- `io`
- `math`
- `string`
- `mem`

## Resolution behavior

Module and import handling occurs during semantic/pipeline stages via module resolver and symbol registration.
