## Requirements

- Python `3.13+`
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency and environment management

git clone https://github.com/airbus5717/a7-py.git
cd a7-py
uv sync
```

## Verify installation

Run one example through compile mode:

```bash
uv run python main.py examples/001_hello.a7
```

Expected result: generated file `examples/001_hello.zig`.
