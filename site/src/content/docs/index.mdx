## Source material

This site is curated from repository sources:

- `README.md` for usage and workflow
- `docs/SPEC.md` for language rules and grammar
- `examples/*.a7` for runnable snippets
- `CHANGELOG.md` and `MISSING_FEATURES.md` for status

Major language pages were rewritten into smaller sections for easier navigation while preserving semantics.
