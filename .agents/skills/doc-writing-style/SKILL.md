# Documentation Style Standard

Write in clear, professional language.
Keep the tone human, direct, and precise.
Use short to medium sentences.
Remove filler and promotional wording.

## Core Rules

- Prefer active voice and concrete wording.
- Use exact terms, values, and file paths when relevant.
- Keep examples data-oriented and runnable.
- Keep paragraphs brief and focused.
- Avoid rhetorical questions.
- Avoid sentence punctuation dashes.

## Avoid

- Hype phrases such as `dive into`, `unleash`, and `game changing`.
- Invitation phrasing such as `let us take a look` or `join me`.
- Edge filler words such as `basically`, `clearly`, or `interestingly`.
- Redundant structures such as `X and also Y`.
- Slang or informal commentary.

## Rewrite Requirements

- Preserve original meaning.
- Match content type.
- Keep required details.
- Improve clarity without changing technical behavior.

## Review Check

Read the result aloud once.
If the text sounds casual, promotional, or stiff, revise it.
