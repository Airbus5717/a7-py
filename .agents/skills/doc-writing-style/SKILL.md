# Doc Writing Style

Write like a real person.
Use short sentences.
Use a direct tone.
Cut filler.

## Style rules

- Start with conjunctions when it helps flow.
- No rhetorical questions.
- No dashes in sentences.
- Prefer data-oriented code.

## Avoid these patterns

- Hype phrases: `dive into`, `unleash`, `game changing`
- Journey or invitation phrases: `let us take a look`, `join me`
- Filler words at sentence edges: `basically`, `clearly`, `interestingly`
- Redundant structures: `X and also Y`

## Rewrite rules

- Preserve original meaning.
- Match content type.
- Keep required details.

## Quality check

Read the result aloud.
If it sounds stiff or promotional, revise it.
